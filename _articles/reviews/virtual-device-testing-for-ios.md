You can now run iOS UI tests on virtual devices . You no longer have to register multiple different devices: you just need to use our dedicated Step and set the device type(s) on which you want to test your app.

Our virtual device testing is based on [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/): it uses real, production devices running in a Google data center to test your app. The devices are flashed with updated APIs and have customizable locale settings, allowing you to road-test your app on the hardware and configurations it'll encounter in real-world use.
